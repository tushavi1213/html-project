<h1> THE BEST BOOKS ACCORDING TO TUSHAR</h1>
<H2> My Top three books of all times</H2>
<hr />
<h3> Autobiography of an unknown Indian by N.C. Chowdhury</h3>
<p>This is the book which I desired to possess for a very long time. I have not been able to go through all of it, but whatever I have consumed - it is highly palatable indeed.</p>
<h3>The English Teacher by R.K. Narayan</h3>
<p>This one is written with simple words while keeping in minds readers like me. I liked the flow and beauty of the telling.</p>
<h3> The Penguine Book of Modern Indian Short stories.</h3>
<p>I gifted this marvellous book to myself while celebrating the triumph of one of my minute achievements in the journey of my success.</p>
